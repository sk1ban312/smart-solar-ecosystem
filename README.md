## About The Project

Our project is a smart solar energy monitoring and management system that takes a standard setup — solar panel, inverter, and battery — and upgrades it into an intelligent, connected platform. We installed sensors to measure current, voltage, battery temperature, and sunlight intensity, feeding this data into an ESP32 microcontroller. The microcontroller processes these readings and sends them via Wi-Fi to a cloud server.

From there, the information is displayed in a custom-built web dashboard with a live feed that shows how much energy the panel is generating, the state of charge of the battery, and environmental conditions in real time. The system also integrates an AI model that uses weather forecasts and historical data to predict how much energy the panel will produce, while a financial module calculates monthly savings, payback time, and return on investment.

This project demonstrates a scalable ecosystem combining hardware, software, AI, and financial modeling.

## System Architecture

The system is composed of two primary domains: the physical hardware for data collection and the cloud software for processing, analysis, and presentation.

## Hardware Components & Workflow

The physical prototype was built using the following off-the-shelf components to create a robust data collection pipeline:

*   **1. Solar Panel (`SOLPERK 20W Solar Panel Kit`):** Generates DC electricity from sunlight.
*   **2. Battery (`ExpertPower 12V 8AH SLA`):** Stores excess energy generated by the panel.
*   **3. Power Inverter (`150W Power Inverter`):** Converts the battery's 12V DC power to 110V AC.
*   **4. Microcontroller (`LAFVIN ESP32 Basic Starter Kit`):** The core of the system. It collects sensor data, processes it, and sends it to the cloud via its built-in Wi-Fi.
*   **5. Current/Voltage Sensor (`HiLetgo INA219`):** A bi-directional I2C sensor that precisely measures power flow (voltage and current) from the solar panel.
*   **6. Temperature Sensor (`BOJACK DS18B20 Waterproof`):** Monitors the ambient temperature of the system components.
*   **7. Buck Converter (`HiLetgo 2pcs LM2596`):** Steps down the voltage to safely power the microcontroller and sensors from the main battery.

## Technology Stack & APIs

This project leverages a modern, full-stack architecture to deliver a seamless experience from hardware to browser.

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **Framework:** Next.js / React.js
    *   **Styling:** CSS Modules with a custom theme
    *   **Data Fetching:** Axios for REST API communication
*   **Backend:**
    *   **Framework:** Python Flask
    *   **API Design:** RESTful principles for clear client-server communication
    *   **WSGI Server:** Gunicorn
*   **Database:**
    *   **Service:** Google Firebase (Realtime Database) for live, low-latency data synchronization.
*   **Platforms & APIs:**
    *   **Deployment:** Vercel, with a CI/CD pipeline linked directly to the GitHub repository for automatic deployments.
    *   **AI & Machine Learning:** OpenAI API (GPT-3.5 Turbo) for weather-based generation forecasting.
    *   **External Data:** National Weather Service (weather.gov) API for real-time weather data.

## Development Workflow

This project was managed using professional development practices to ensure code quality and efficient deployment.

*   **Version Control:** Git was used for version control, with **GitHub Desktop** providing a streamlined GUI for commits, pushes, and branch management.
*   **Continuous Deployment:** The `main` branch of this repository is linked to Vercel. Every push to `main` automatically triggers a new build and deployment of the frontend application, ensuring the live demo is always up-to-date.
*   **API Management:** The backend Flask API is containerized using Docker and is designed to be deployed on any cloud platform. Environment variables are used for sensitive keys (like the OpenAI key) to maintain security best practices.
