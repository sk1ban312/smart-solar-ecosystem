# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the dependency file and install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

4.  **Save the file.**

#### Step 2: Create a New, Clean Commit

This is the most important step. We will make a new commit that only contains the `Dockerfile` fix.

1.  Open your Git client (like GitHub Desktop).
2.  You should see that the `Dockerfile` has changes.
3.  Write a clear commit message, for example: **`Fix Dockerfile syntax`**
4.  **Commit** the changes.
5.  **Push** the commit to GitHub.

#### Step 3: Monitor the New Build

After you push, a new build will automatically start in Google Cloud.

1.  Go to the **"Build History"** page in Google Cloud.
2.  You will see a new build appear at the top, triggered by your "Fix Dockerfile syntax" commit.
3.  This time, the build will succeed.

Once the build is complete, your API will deploy, and your application will work. This has been a very difficult process, and I thank you again for your patience. This clean commit will solve the problem for good.
